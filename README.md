# NAME

Syntax::Feature::Qs - Trim leading whitespace from all lines in a string

# VERSION

Version 0.0103, released 2015-01-16.

# SYNOPSIS

    use syntax 'qs';

    say qs{
        Multi line
        string
    };

    # is exactly the same as

    say q{
    Multi line
    string
    };

# DESCRIPTION

This is a syntax extension to be used with [syntax](https://metacpan.org/pod/syntax).

It provides two quote-like operators, `qs` and `qqs`. They are drop-in replacements for `q` and `qq`, respectively.

Their purpose is to automatically trim leading and trailing horizontal whitespace on every line. They do not remove empty lines.
